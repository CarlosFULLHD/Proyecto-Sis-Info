## About the Project

Studio Cuisine is a restaurant that manages different lines of food within a dark kitchen. The food lines include:

- **Combi**: Fast food.
- **MÃ¡ito Chifa**: Peruvian Chifa.
- **Lego Burger**: Customized burgers.

## Installation(With docker)

### Using Docker Compose

To facilitate the installation and configuration of the project, we will use Docker Compose. Docker Compose allows us to define and run multi-container Docker applications easily and efficiently.

#### Prerequisites

- Docker

#### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the project repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CarlosFULLHD/Proyecto-Sis-Info.git
   cd Proyecto-Sis-Info/
   ```

2. **Configure Docker Compose**:

   - The `docker-compose.yml` file defines two services: one for the MySQL database and another for the Flask web application.
   - The database is initialized with the schema provided in `studiocuisine.sql`.
   - The web application is configured to run Flask in development mode.

3. **Run Docker Compose** to build and start the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command performs the following actions:

   - Builds the Docker image for the web application.
   - Configures and starts a MySQL container, initializing it with the specified database.
   - Configures and starts a container for the Flask web application.

4. **Access the application**:
   - Once the containers are up and running, the application will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

#### Technical Details of Docker Compose and Dockerfile

- **Dockerfile**:

  - Uses an official Python 3.10 base image.
  - Sets the working directory to `/app`.
  - Copies the requirements file and installs the necessary dependencies.
  - Copies the rest of the application to the container.
  - Exposes port 5000 and sets the startup command to run Flask.

- **docker-compose.yml**:
  - Defines two services:
    - `db`: Configures MySQL with the necessary parameters and uses the `studiocuisine.sql` file to initialize the database.
    - `web`: Builds the web application image, establishes dependencies on the database service, and exposes port 5000 for the web application.

### Installation( for local development Dockerfile)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app/main.py
```

### issues

- sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
